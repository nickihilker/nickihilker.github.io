		<h1>Frogger Python Project</h1>
		<h2> Description</h2>
		<p>My team made a game based on the game Frogger. You can move up, down, left, and right,
		and you can't go outside of the margins of the screen. There is a player, that is a green
		dot, and three enemies. The enemies move back and forth at different speeds. When the player
		touches one of the enemies, it is sent back to where it began, and a live is taken away. It
		started with 5 lives. When the lives are down to 0, the enemies stop moving.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The github repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/nickihilker/Project/blob/master/Python%20project.py">here<a/></p>

		<br>
		<p> This is the start of the game. You can move the objects left, right, up, and down, using 
		the W, A, S, and D keys. Left=A, Right=D, Up=W, and Down=S. The logs (rectangles) move at different
		speeds and different ways. You win by getting to the top of the screen.</p>
		<br>

		<br>
		<p> This is after you lose the game. You lose by touching the logs five times. Once you hit them 
		five times, everything stops, and the game is over. </p>
		<br>

		<br>
		<p>This was our hardest piece of coding. The player needs to be sent back to start when it hits an
		enemy, which is what this coding shows. My team made a small black square with the same coordinates
		that the player started at. </p>
		<br>
		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>The hardest part was getting the logs to send the frog back to start once it was hit. We were
		able to solve this problem by making a black square, so you couldn't see it through the
		background, and used the coordinates of the black square to be sent back.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The programs we used were canopy and github.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I contributed every day I was there. I thought of making the black square which sent back the
		frog to zero once it had been hit. I helped make the coordinates and the colors for the player
		and the enemies. Also, I wrote the code so the objects wouldn't go outside the margins, and made 
		the enemies go at different speeds.</p>
		<br>
		<p>To make the project better, I would have changed the colors. Also, I would hav found a different
		way for the player to go back to start without putting a black suare, because if I needed to change
		any of the colors, or have the background change, I would have also had to change that. Another
		thing I would change is have the logs (or enemies) be thicker, and have more of them. Another thing
		I would change is make more levels, had I had more time. The last thing I would change would be when
		you get to the top of the screen, everything stops, and it tells you that you win. </p>
		<br>
		<p>What I would do the same is keep the player/logs from going out the sides, and keep the same amount
		of lives. Also I would keep the player moving the same way, with the WASD keys. </p>
